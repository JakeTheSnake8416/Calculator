Mathematics > Calculator.cs is a Calculator for C#. It's like Math.____(), but better in some ways and worse in others.

Some key differences are that any root can be found rather than just the square root (cube root, 4th root, etc.). A number can be factored
(which only kind of works). When rounding, you can round decimals to a certain number of places rather than just 
removing everything after the decimal point. There are also a few other unique features, however, it is also missing some things like Cosin,
Sin, and Tangent for example.
